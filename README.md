**Augmy is an app that empowers you to express your true feelings with clarity and emotion**, offering a deeper way to connect through chat beyond words and labels.

## 🧠 Real People, Real Spaces

Online spaces are increasingly turning into a combination of AI-generated slop and inauthentic, overly curated texts and profiles that may as well be AI-generated.

**Fuck the robots**, we've got to make some space for ourselves in this binary world and empower what makes us human.

Even if people do try to express themselves and their ideas in a "human way", it can't possibly ever overcome the limits given by centralized tech companies that build their apps only as tools — rigid software.

They are not designed to be social spaces, where people spend a large portion of their lives and interact with the people they care about every day.

## 🛠️ Independent and Community-Driven

We have no investors, nor any large parent company over our heads.  
That's why we can also focus on things that don't directly contribute to any profits.

There are obvious drawbacks, though, so **we would greatly appreciate your support!**  
Every supporter has a say in the development, so you not only contribute to our cause, **you partake in it**.

## (R)evolutionizing Communication

That's the reason behind **Augmy** — humanize interactions online and bring (r)evolution into practice in how we communicate today.

Forget about being an essayist and expressive writer in order to tell how you feel.  
We've got to start from scratch, forget about the limits we've imposed on ourselves and, instead, attempt to find **new ways, better ways**.
