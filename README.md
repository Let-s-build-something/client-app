We make online communication more authentic, making it feel more human again.
People fall for fake profiles and AI messages for a reason. A profile is just a collection of information about a given person, interchangeable, just plain text and images, no matter the author. Similarly, a message remains the same no matter who sends it, making its author and the context in which it was written almost irrelevant.

This fundamental flaw in how our expressions are translated into content online is exactly the reason why we consume social interactions online, and rarely truly interact.

Our app messenger, Augmy, helps users to communicate more naturally and meaningfully, making it easier to express themselves and understand others. Each message has embedded nuances gathered from the way an author voiced themselves, which allows others to grasp the message as it was meant, in its full color. We also collaborate with researchers to streamline their work, making studies on communication online quicker and more cost-effective. Our goal is to automate sampling, development, and collection within users' natural environment, not just a limited prototype. It is also important to us to share our technology and know-how with other businesses that strive to make their users' communication meaningful and expressive. Augmy or its subparts can be easily integrated into any app or platform, enhancing communication anywhere needed, for whichever purpose.
